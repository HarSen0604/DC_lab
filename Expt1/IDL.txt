* An IDL is a file (suffixed with `.x`) which optionally begins with a bunch of type definitions and then defines the remote procedures.
* A set of remote procedures are grouped into a version.
* One or more versions are grouped into a program.

Note: 
* Install rpcbind in your machine (`sudo apt-get install rpcbind`)
* Type `rpcinfo`

Compile this IDL file by using the following command. `rpcgen -a -C add.x`
`-C` 	=> C language
`-a` 	=> generate all the files including samples

It will generate the following files:
	add.h			-> header file
	add_client.c	-> client program
	add_clnt.c		-> client stub
	add_server.c	-> server program
	add_svc.c		-> server skeleton
	add_xdr.c		-> XDR routines used by both the client and the server
	Makefile.add	-> Makefile
